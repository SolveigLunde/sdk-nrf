config MAX_THROUGHPUT

		Enable configuration options for maximum throughput sample

	depends on MAX_THROUGHPUT
	help
		Number of scanner devices that will participate in the PAwR communication.
		This affects memory usage and timing calculations.
		IMPORTANT: This value must match the NUM_SYNCHRONIZERS in run_devices.sh
		
		Optimal configurations within 1650-byte buffer limit:
		- 16 devices × 102 bytes = 1632 bytes (98.9% efficiency)
		- 12 devices × 137 bytes = 1644 bytes (99.6% efficiency)
		- 8 devices × 206 bytes = 1648 bytes (99.9% efficiency)
		
		Higher device counts require smaller packet sizes to fit buffer constraints.

config BT_MAX_THROUGHPUT_PAWR_INTERVAL_MS
	int "PAwR advertising interval (ms)"
	default 150
	range 20 2000
	depends on MAX_THROUGHPUT
	help
		Interval between periodic advertising events in milliseconds.
		Lower values increase throughput but consume more power.
		
		Recommended intervals for optimal throughput:
		- 100ms: Higher throughput, more power consumption
		- 150ms: Good balance of throughput and power (RECOMMENDED)
		- 200ms: Lower power, reduced throughput
