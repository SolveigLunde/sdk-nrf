Step-by-step how to run the sample on physical dks: 
-----------------------------------------------------

First, some small alterations that might need to be made: 

In prj.conf (both sync and adv) uncomment the last lines of code if it is commented out. 
It can be there for simulations in bsim as well but it just gave a lot more prints making it look a bit messy. 
Also remember to set the number of devices to the amout you acctually have, it will just freeze if you forget and its annoying to have to rebuild everything.

-----------------------------------------------------
Step 1. connecting DKs

Connect the DKs to the computer
To get access to the DK from wsl follow this quide: https://github.com/balaji-srin/nrf-wsl-guide/tree/main#readme

Step 2. In wsl

confirm dk ids and ports
Go to docker -> run nrfjprog --com 
Note the comms as you could use this in step 5

If you do not have nrfjprog download it (but should be in the docker image)

Step 3. Build sample from folder

```bash
    #Advertiser: 
    west build -p always -b nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp 

    #Sync scanner: 
    west build -p always -b nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp
```

Note: remember to set the number of devices in prj.conf before building the advertiser

Step 4. Flash roles to the DKs

```bash
    #Advertiser
    west flash -d periodic_adv_rsp/build --snr <id-number>

    #Sync scanners (repeat for number of devices. Remember to change id)
    west flash -d periodic_sync_rsp/build --snr <id-number>

    #Example: 
    west flash -d periodic_adv_rsp/build --snr 1057716157
```

Step 5. View logs

Open one terminal for each device (sync + adv) and go into docker
    ```bash
    # Example: DK 1057716157 (VCOM0)
    /bin/stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 raw -echo -icrnl -onlcr -ixon -ixoff 115200
    /bin/cat /dev/ttyACM0
    ```
    ```bash
    # DK 1057717549 (VCOM0)
    /bin/stty -F /dev/ttyACM2 raw -echo -icrnl -onlcr -ixon -ixoff 115200
    /bin/cat /dev/ttyACM2
    ```
    ```bash
    # DK 1057785361 (VCOM0)
    /bin/stty -F /dev/ttyACM4 raw -echo -icrnl -onlcr -ixon -ixoff 115200
    /bin/cat /dev/ttyACM4
    ```
Press the DK’s reset button after connecting.
If a VCOM0 is silent, try that DK’s VCOM1 (`/dev/ttyACM1`, `/dev/ttyACM3`, `/dev/ttyACM5`) at 115200. Or just try all the com from step 2
Exit with Ctrl-C.
